This is mostly not my own code found a youtube tutorial that I mostly coppied.

This was a project I was working on to understand how a OS works.
I have always had a passion for finding out how a computer works and liked to get as low level as
possible. This taught me about the boot sector,boot loaders and somve very basice of how a computer
first boots. Was very intesting to understand just how much it not available before the bootloader
does it work and was very fascinating learning C calling convintions to call C code from ASM. I loved
learing how to program in ASM because of my CPU project I worked on it felt like I had full control over
the system at the lowest level posible.
