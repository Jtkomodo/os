<h1>Project to learn how a OS works</h1>
<i>This is mostly not my own code found a YouTube tutorial that I mostly copied.</i>

<p>This was a project I was working on to understand how an OS works. I have always had a passion for finding out how a computer works and liked to get as low a level as possible. This taught me about the boot sector, boot loaders, and some very basics of how a computer first boots. Was very interesting to understand just how much it was not available before the bootloader work and was very fascinating learning C calling conventions to call C code from ASM. I loved learning how to program in ASM because of the CPU project I worked on it felt like I had full control over the system at the lowest level possible.<p>
